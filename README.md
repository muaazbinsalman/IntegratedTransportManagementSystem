# 🚆 Integrated Transport Management System

## 📌 About
**Integrated Transport Management System** is a full‑stack transport booking solution designed to streamline journey planning and reservation. This project offers a sleek, responsive frontend combined with a robust C++ CGI backend that handles dynamic passenger input, station selection, fare calculations (with discount conditions based on journey time), and real‑time booking confirmations—all displayed on one beautifully styled page.

Built using:
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (AJAX via the Fetch API)
- **Backend:** C++ CGI scripting (compiled into an executable)
- **Server:** Apache (with CGI enabled via `.htaccess`)

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Dynamic Passenger Input:** Automatically generates the required input fields based on the number of passengers.
- **Time Validation:** Enforces HH:MM format using an HTML5 time input with backend validation to ensure hours are 0–23 and minutes 0–59.
- **Station Selection & Train Choice:** List of fixed stations and the option to choose between two train types.
- **Automated Fare Calculation:** Computes total fare with a 40% discount if the journey time falls within a preset discount window.
- **AJAX-Based Interaction:** Submits booking details via AJAX to display confirmation or error messages on the same, sleek page.
- **Sleek, Modern UI:** Designed with a contemporary dark theme and blue call-to-action buttons for an elegant user experience.
